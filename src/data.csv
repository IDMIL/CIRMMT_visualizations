Distinguished Lecture,mwnPQOoNKTQ,2007/10/25,Musical Origins: Processing Temporal and Spectral Patterns in Infancy,"Early Development, Music, Brain, Perception, Auditory Development",Neuroscience,"Cognition, Perception and Movement","Across human societies, music remains a universal experience that all of us - young and old - come to experience. From our youngest days as infants, we are exposed to music through the singing of lullabies or rhythm from ""bouncing"". In this Distinguished Lecture, Professor Laurel Trainor talks about the origins of music in a developmental sense - how early can humans recognize and learn rhythm and pitch structures, and do specific musical experiences from childhood affect brain development? Various studies are explored, showing that even infants can be sensitive to consonance and dissonance, exhibit the ability to extract rhythmic, or metrical structure, and that the auditory cortex can rapidly mature between the ages of 2-6 months.",Laurel Trainor,McMaster University,Canada
Distinguished Lecture,8mzQRnWAu2A,2008/01/17,Obstinate systems: Resistance as process in interactive performance,"interactive music, digital musical instruments, Max/MSP, ",New Interfaces for Musical Expression,"Instruments, Devices and Systems","Butch Rovan describes several pieces in which interactive audio systems are designed to resist the performers. The obstinacy of these systems is taken as a creative impetus, and the performer must work with—and against—them, finding themselves in a collaborative relationship with these computational co-performers, exploring musical and creative terrain where they might not normally find themselves.",Butch Rovan,Brown University,USA
Distinguished Lecture,GRrElxJkvIc,2008/02/21,Oscillation regimes of musical wind instruments: The points of view of the physicist and the instrumentalist ,"bifurcation schemes, acoustics, clarinet, oscillation regimes, self-sustained oscillations",Musical Acoustics & Instruments,"Instruments, Devices and Systems","Depending on the musical instrument, it is possible to produce up to 20 different sounds with one single fingering. This relationship between fingering and resulting sound is determined by the oscillation regimes, which is why it is essential for the musician to learn to control them. Dr. Kergomard shows how these regimes apply to wind instruments, particularly the clarinet. Using different models and bifurcation schemes, he investigates the behavior of sound in nonlinear systems. His lecture includes a review of elementary acoustics, results from an experiment that uses an artificial mouth, and even a theoretical explanation of why clarinets squeak.",Jean Kergomard,"Laboratoire de Mécanique et d'Acoustique, CNRS",France
Distinguished Lecture,D5EJLQlUigM,2009/03/27,Mining for the Meaning of Music,"rhythm, melody, motif, principal component analysis, beat tracker",Music Information Retrieval,Music Information Research,"What does the term ""music"" denote? Can we define music?  As a professor of electrical engineering and leader of the Laboratory for Recognition and Organization of Speech and Audio (LabROSA), Ellis explores large collections of music samples in order to produce “a condensed space” in which to identify and label musical qualities and provide definitions. His extensive research has encompassed drumbeat rhythms and melody analysis. The aim of his melody research is to provide a dictionary of common motifs (clichés) in musical melodies. Additionally, Ellis studies the meanings or labels individuals attribute to music, and this research, in turn, has implications as to how music is to be classified.",Dan Ellis,Columbia University,USA
Distinguished Lecture,VjSMna75fxY,2008/04/17,Sound Actions: Human Movement in the Perception and Cognition of Music,"Perception, Cognition, Movement, Music Theory, ",Movement,"Cognition, Perception and Movement","Movement is everywhere: from walking down the street, to hand gestures while speaking, to a musician's movement during a performance. Regardless of musical training and background, humans are observed to spontaneously generate movements that reflect musical features. In this lecture, Professor Godoy reviews various studies on music and movement and how these findings may influence other areas of music research such as music perception cognition and music theory. By examining the link between music and movement, Prof. Godoy speaks on how human movement plays an integral part in music perception and music cognition in general. The lecture ends with a conclusion of topics, as well as issues, concerns, and suggestions for future work.",Rolf Inge Godøy,University of Oslo,Norway
Distinguished Lecture,S7AOZIGP9Ys,2008/10/16,Slippery Rocks: A Low-Tech Percussionist Navigates the Crosscurrents of Music Technology,"Percussion, Music Technology, Performance Practice, Performance, Contemporary Music",Music Performance and Education,Expanded Musical Practice,"Percussion and music technology have often been lumped together as ""new technology from the 20th century,"" involving the ""liberation"" or refinement of sound, and largely involving the culture of addition. In this lecture, Steven Schick talks about how concepts regarding percussion and performance might transpose into the realm of music technology. The exploratory and forward-moving thinking of music from the late 20th and early 21st century often driven by creators (such as engineers) and composers, and the process of consolidation - the creation of language and performance practice - often driven by performers is discussed. This lecture examines the role of performer and consolidation, the concept of meaningful limits, and closes with Prof. Schicks musical examples (41:17).",Steven Schick,"University of California, San Diego",USA
Distinguished Lecture,CxFVjKMsaTc,2009/01/22,The voice as a musical instrument,"voice source, tuning formants, vocal economy, formant cluster, voice timbre, fundamental frequency, partials",Musical Acoustics & Instruments,"Instruments, Devices and Systems","How do singers produce and project their voice, doing so in a way that reaches different levels of expressivity? In a very didactic lecture, Dr. Sundberg unveils these aspects of singing. He starts with a comprehensive yet concise explanation of the physiological and acoustic components of the voice, especially the tuning formants. Following is a discussion on strategies adopted by professional singers to ensure vocal economy, like the manipulation of the first formant and the formant cluster used by female and male singers respectively. Finally, he investigates three principles associated with expressiveness: tempo changes to mark the structure, intonation variation to emphasize contrasts, and time of tone onset to reinforce important notes.",Johan Sundberg,Royal Institute of Technology,Sweden
Distinguished Lecture,z_sFVFsENMg,2009/02/19,Tonality as a colonizing force in African music ,"tonality, African colonization, Protestant hymn, pre-colonial African soundscape, pygmy singing, pentatonism",Music Theory,Music Information Research,"Dr. Agawu defines tonality as a “hierarchically organized system of relations animated by desire,” that, according to him, has been used as both instrument of control and creative language. His lecture is centered on the colonizing potential of forms of tonality exported to Africa mainly through the Protestant hymn, thereby affecting the soundscape of costal regions and urban locations. His discussion on the features of the imagined sound of pre-colonial Africa and the responses to European tonality includes musical excerpts from pygmy pentatonic singing, dundun drumming, art music by the composer Joshua Uzoigwe, and new traditional music. All musical examples are thoroughly analyzed, leading to a profound insight into the dynamics of tonal influences.",Kofi Agawu,Princeton University,USA
Distinguished Lecture,UAPEVDPvlE8,2009/03/26,Musical Memories in Normal and Disordered Aging,"Aging, Perception, Cognition, Dementia, Alzheimer's,",Perception and Cognition,"Cognition, Perception and Movement","Caregivers often report witnessing a positive effect of music on a patient with dementia. While the aging brain may face cognitive difficulties, particularly those suffering from dementia of the Alzheimer's type, normal aging patients as well as those in moderate to severe stages of dementia can exhibit preserved memory for melody and lyrics. In this talk, Professor Lola Cuddy explores the topic of music and the aging brain by speaking on approaches to studying musical memory, with a focus on melodies, the challenges of research in patients with dementia, and her own work. Various case studies and their data are examined, and a brief overview of the work done in this field is explored.",Lola Cuddy,Queen's University,Canada
Distinguished Lecture,XLBOBMY_vDQ,2009/04/16,Music and emotion: Toward Computational Models of Empathy and Entrainment,"emotion, society, research, computation",Computer Music Systems,"Cognition, Perception and Movement","Camurri provides a one-of-a-kind insight into the ground-breaking research he is currently conducting at Italy's University of Genoa, which involves examining the relevance of the performing arts and their potential contribution to the progression of technology and science. He has done much of his work with dancers, getting them to express various emotions through the same choreography and studying how automatic recognition programs allow us to electronically interpret their movement. With this kind of information, he is then able to extrapolate something much bigger: the understanding of empathy and synchronization between people in social environments.",Antonio Camurri,University of Genoa,Italy
Distinguished Lecture,UN_j04vyvS0,2009/09/24,Learning structures in natural sounds,"evolutionary biology, computer science, technology, programming",Audio Processing,"Cognition, Perception and Movement","Lewicki looks at the processing of sound in two facets: the digital processing and analysis of audio tracks (engineering), and the physical structure of human aural mechanisms, the ear (physiology). Because his work deals with both physics and biology, he must find a way to reconcile both familiar laws of physics as well as logic of evolutionary biology as it applies to humans. Like many others, he uses theoretical models from nature to form efficient coding theory - and eventually uses this to learn about higher-order structure. In other words, computer programming is used to analyze sets of audio data from the biological world, which can then tell us about physical structures of organisms that evolved.",Michael Lewicki,Case Western Reserve University,USA
Distinguished Lecture,rn2_fFcRZlY,2009/10/25,The sound of orchestras and soloists as a combination of room acoustics and acoustical properties of the musical instruments,"acoustics, sound radiation, acoustic properties, orchestra's seating arrangement, decay, loudness, synchronicity, sound level, masking effect",Musical Acoustics & Instruments,"Instruments, Devices and Systems","When it comes down to understanding the resulting sound of a musical performance, Dr. Meyer shows that there is much more to be considered than what musicians usually pay attention to. The room acoustics and the acoustic properties of the instruments, he explains, have an impact on the sound impression of the listener. His lecture includes an encompassing discussion on reverberation, decay times of multiple instruments, loudness curves, synchronicity (rhythmic precision) in chamber music, and sound radiation. Based on acoustical and artistic arguments, he also addresses the differences between the German (classical) and the American orchestral seating arrangement. Lastly, he discusses the acoustic demands from the point of view of the performer and the conductor.",Jurgen Meyer,University of Music Detmold,Germany

Alongside his numerous stories of working with stars including Frank Sinatra and Billy Joel, he describes the process of learning his craft through apprenticeship and innovation. Despite his roots in traditional music formats, he embraces the development of digital music with positivity - it's a ""new beginning"", and he insists that future generations need to have the best music with the best sound made available.",Phil Ramone,Record producer,USA
Distinguished Lecture,VOYWnUEq7yA,2009/11/19,Music again: Perspectives on repetition in music,"repetition, analysis, perception, classical, songs",Music Theory,"Cognition, Perception and Movement","Repetition - it is a defining characteristic of music, yet this seems to be the only form of artistry where it is commonly seen and even welcomed. It's what makes music social and shareable, and allows for the creation of interpersonal cohesion - well-known nursery rhymes are sung early on by children, for example, and the familiarity of old pieces of music provides comfort and a link to past memories. Margulis talks about her intuition for why the first notes of one's favourite song might spark their excitement, and how repeating motives might exist to serve as connections to people and things in the real world - as well as differentiating and bringing attention to otherwise unnoticeable elements.",Lisa Margulis,University of Arkansas,USA
Distinguished Lecture,Vzf19l-Ztsk,2010/01/21,Does Music Make You Smarter,"mozart effect, intellectual benefit, music lessons, psychology ",Perception and Cognition,Expanded Musical Practice,"The popular theory of the “Mozart Effect” states that listening to the music of Mozart increases intellectual ability by priming the brain. Schellenberg presents research-based conclusions concerning the idea of unique intellectual benefits surrounding music listening and music lessons. His research has uncovered a “Schubert Effect” associated with listening to the music of Schubert and even a “King Effect” from listening to a Stephen King audio book. Schellenberg concludes that music, among other such “catalysts”, can affect arousal and mood, which, in turn, affects performance on intellectual tasks. Further, unlike other common out-of-school activities, music lessons are associated with small but broad intellectual benefits. ",Glenn Schellenberg,University of Toronto,Canada
Distinguished Lecture,wf_FfC9Uq3U,2010/03/25,Reverse Engineering the Violin,"reverse engineering, violin, instrument design",Musical Acoustics & Instruments,"Instruments, Devices and Systems","Have you ever wondered exactly why violins are made the way they are? What aspects of the modern violin lend themselves to the instrument’s sound, strength, and durability? What could we do differently were we to re-invent the violin? Woodhouse provides an engineer’s perspective as he explores such questions and offers unique insight on the design and possible future re-designing of the violin. He presents the audience with a variety of considerations on details such as the impedance of materials, types of wood and glue, the use of arches, purfling, and slots (f holes) in the design of the instrument, and more.",Jim Woodhouse,Cambridge University,UK

Research, music-information retrieval, machine learning, data ambiguity, model building",Music Information Retrieval,Music Information Research,"In the last decades, the volume and multi-media usage of online music use has exploded. Personalized data from photos, videos, ratings, tags and posts is now abundantly available, resulting in rich yet “noisy”, or context-dependent data. Many tools using this data for user and advertiser satisfaction are no longer adequate. In response, Yahoo! Research is developing tools to increase and improve data. Slaney details these tools and advocates for a “more data wins” approach to data collection, so that one can have more ways to look at, and make judgements about, data or prospective solutions. Discussion is centred around machine learning tools and model-building designed to sift through the vast swaths of data.",Malcolm Slaney,Yahoo! Research Laboratory,USA

From questioning what makes a digital musical instrument appropriate for live improvisation, to techniques for complex interface-to-sound mappings, to e-textiles, to loudspeaker design, and even hearing aids, Wessel's research touches on a variety of subjects and application areas. With a pragmatic focus, Wessel offers his perspective on these subjects, the guidelines he has learned for himself, and his vision of what is next to come.",David Wessel,"University of California, Berkeley",USA
Fulbright Seminar,C2XKzCQ_Uj4,2011/01/13,"Music, gesture, and musical grammar","musical gesture, musical grammar, physical gesture",Movement,"Cognition, Perception and Movement","Threading together music, movement, and grammar, Lawrence Zbikowski argues that musical gestures are sonic analogues of dynamic processes. Tracing the motion of a leaf falling through the air with your hand is an example of a physical gesture representing a dynamic process: everyone understands that your hand only represents the leaf, but the gesture perfectly encapsulates the motion. Zibikowski suggests that the pairing of musical and physical gestures represent dynamic processes central to human experience, forming musical grammar. Musical gestures exist in a well-defined context—meter and pitch space—so their measurable properties can lend meaning to corresponding physical gestures.",Lawrence Zbikowski,The University of Chicago,USA
Distinguished Lecture,ii6VtnUVsok,2011/02/17,Building Musical Minds in 18th Century Naples,"schemata, musical patterns, 18th century composition",Musicology,Expanded Musical Practice,"Beginning with the conservatory tradition of 18th century Naples, Robert Gjerdingen discusses the use of schemata in improvisation and composition. Schemata are stock harmonic patterns, a lexicon of solfegi melodies and partimenti bass patterns that permeated 18th and 19th century music. Learning the schemata allows practitioners to build a phrasacon of musical idioms, and gain an understanding of the collocation (how the material fits together) and appropriate frequency of the different patterns. In this tradition, practitioners learn a corpus of coherent utterances, as to not only grasp the mechanics of the patterns, but learn the style of the musical tradition.",Robert Gjerdingen,Northwestern University,USA

Pioneering contributor to computer music, Risset, explores the possibilities of computer sound synthesis in composition. Beyond this topic, he delves into the psychoacoustics of sound: how we interpret what we hear. Risset shares how modern computer sound synthesis has ushered in new and varied possibilities that are increasingly congenial to our senses. As Risset proposes, there seems to be an aspect of magic in music that can be enhanced by using the somewhat extreme features of perception involved in synthesis.",Jean-Claude Risset,Laboratoire de Mécanique et d'Acoustique,France

This is what Marco Stroppa has done a lot of thinking about, and he has spent his research work experimenting with acoustic piano sounds and their resonances - and also the complex process of digitalized composing not with these exact sonorities but unique ones inspired by them. As a composer with much experience and knowledge in piano techniques and instrumentation, he dives into the technical details of creating ""pure"" and ""noisy"" tone, as well as artistic lines and creativity. Compositionally, he gives the possibilities and choices of sound synthesis and cognition a great deal of consideration.",Marco Stroppa,"Musikhochschule, Stuttgart",Germany

Each stroke is created quasi-linguistically via variation in place and manner of articulation, and each bol represents a stroke. Patel argues that bols are a case of “sound symbolism”: in tabla drumming, musical timbres are both reflective by and reflective of speech timbres. Using empirical data, Patel suggests that for experienced drummers, the areas of the brain know to be activated by speech would also be activated by tabla timbres.",Ani Patel,The Neurosciences Institute,USA

Her research grapples with the use of motion in musical expressivity during musical performance as evaluated by musicians and non-musicians. Is there an expressive repertoire of gestures, and if so, how are they used? Her research suggests that musicians develop a personal musical movement repertoire within a socio-cultural context. Beyond discussing this repertoire of expressive movements and how it is put into use, Davidson invites us to consider what social studies can add to this discussion.",Jane Davidson,University of Western Australia,Australia

Watch how Dr. Cook answers this question with an approach that combines empirical methodologies and cultural interpretations. Using Schubert’s impromptu Op. 90 nº3 and Chopin’s Mazurka Op. 63, he explains how close listening of recordings ""can open up a dimension to which both music theory and music psychology are insensitive, which is that of historical change"". The lecture includes one of the first schenkerian analysis made by Schenker himself, and new analytical techniques capable of extracting timing and dynamic information. Results show that phrase-arching elements are subjective to historical change, yet data is still insufficient to establish a performance style as a historical entity.",Nicholas Cook,University of Cambridge,UK

D’Alessandro discusses the challenges of augmenting a church organ with electronics for live-electronic performances. Each instrument is voiced for the room, meaning that each of the pipes is carefully balanced with one another to create the desired sound in the hall. In order to augment the instrument electronically, d’Alessandro captured the sound inside of the pipes. He discusses how he used that signal to alter the sound in the hall through various effects and how he used the signal visually, as projected lights onto the pipes.",Christophe d'Alessandro,CNRS,France

In this comprehensive lecture, theories and common beliefs among musicians are scrutinized. Using live and recorded demonstrations, Dr. Askenfelt explains how the stick-slip phenomenon, the Helmholtz circulating corner, the Schelleng’s triangle, and the Guettler’s triangle relate to bowing and to the coordination of bow velocity, bow-bridge distance, and bow force. The evolution of bowing studies is also discussed, including the innovative approach developed by Askenfelt to measure bowing parameters.",Anders Askenfelt,Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Sweden
Distinguished Lecture,LBvmkXzQk48,2013/04/18,Distributed Creativity in Musical Performance,"creativity, performance, classical music",Music Performance and Education,Expanded Musical Practice,"The belief that all musical performances are creative and are once-in-a-lifetime experiences is a truism. What exactly substantiates creativity? How is creativity encapsulated in a classical music performance? Is it what musicians bring to or add to the musical score? What if a score does not exist? Eric Clarke suggests that we can understand creativity in performance as an interweaving of the possibilities of a score or the cultural model, the tacit performance practices of culture, the perception-action capacities of a performer, the affordances of an instrument, the influence of recordings and other performances, and the affordances of the musical material.",Eric Clarke,Univesity of Oxford,UK

Attributing this mismatch to a lack of sensitivity to the needs of music researchers, Wiering advocates a “human-centered” approach to the design of new technologies. Careful study of the stakeholders lies at the center of this approach: what do musicologists do and value? Wiering provides preliminary results of a 500+ participant survey, demonstrating that music researchers are frustrated with the current design of many software packages. Engineers need to design new technology with musicologists, interactively, not for them.",Frans Wiering,Universiteit Utrecht,Netherlands

He shows a new transitional flute that he has developed in conversation with the research. Fabre details the flute player’s basic task of crafting particular jet streams according to the instrument’s resonator and desired tones. He illustrates that the execution of the basic task is dependent on its musical context, where musical intention is correlated to respiratory effort and organized by time shapes, and time shapes depend on one’s musical understanding rather than technique. Further, musical line direction is closely correlated to respiratory effort, which leads Fabre to present a new hypothesis for further study.",Benoit Fabre,Sorbonne Universités – UPMC,France
