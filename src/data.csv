Distinguished Lecture,mwnPQOoNKTQ,2007/10/25,Musical Origins: Processing Temporal and Spectral Patterns in Infancy,Laurel Trainor,McMaster University,Canada,Neuroscience,"Cognition, Perception and Movement (RA3)","Across human societies, music remains a universal experience that all of us - young and old - come to experience. From our youngest days as infants, we are exposed to music through the singing of lullabies or rhythm from ""bouncing"". In this Distinguished Lecture, Professor Laurel Trainor talks about the origins of music in a developmental sense - how early can humans recognize and learn rhythm and pitch structures, and do specific musical experiences from childhood affect brain development? Various studies are explored, showing that even infants can be sensitive to consonance and dissonance, exhibit the ability to extract rhythmic, or metrical structure, and that the auditory cortex can rapidly mature between the ages of 2-6 months.","Early Development, Music, Brain, Perception, Auditory Development"

This relationship between fingering and resulting sound is determined by the oscillation regimes, which is why it is essential for the musician to learn to control them. Dr. Kergomard shows how these regimes apply to wind instruments, particularly the clarinet. Using different models and bifurcation schemes, he investigates the behavior of sound in nonlinear systems. His lecture includes a review of elementary acoustics, results from an experiment that uses an artificial mouth, and even a theoretical explanation of why clarinets squeak.","bifurcation schemes, acoustics, clarinet, oscillation regimes, self-sustained oscillations"
Distinguished Lecture,D5EJLQlUigM,2009/03/27,Mining for the Meaning of Music,Dan Ellis,Columbia University,USA,Music Information Retrieval,Music Information Research (RA2),"What does the term ""music"" denote? Can we define music?  As a professor of electrical engineering and leader of the Laboratory for Recognition and Organization of Speech and Audio (LabROSA), Ellis explores large collections of music samples in order to produce “a condensed space” in which to identify and label musical qualities and provide definitions. His extensive research has encompassed drumbeat rhythms and melody analysis. The aim of his melody research is to provide a dictionary of common motifs (clichés) in musical melodies. Additionally, Ellis studies the meanings or labels individuals attribute to music, and this research, in turn, has implications as to how music is to be classified.","rhythm, melody, motif, principal component analysis, beat tracker"
Distinguished Lecture,VjSMna75fxY,2008/04/17,Sound Actions: Human Movement in the Perception & Cognition of Music,Rolf Inge Godøy,University of Oslo,Norway,Movement,"Cognition, Perception and Movement (RA3)","Movement is everywhere: from walking down the street, to hand gestures while speaking, to a musician's movement during a performance. Regardless of musical training and background, humans are observed to spontaneously generate movements that reflect musical features. In this lecture, Professor Godoy reviews various studies on music and movement and how these findings may influence other areas of music research such as music perception cognition and music theory. By examining the link between music and movement, Prof. Godoy speaks on how human movement plays an integral part in music perception and music cognition in general. The lecture ends with a conclusion of topics, as well as issues, concerns, and suggestions for future work.","Perception, Cognition, Movement, Music Theory, "

In this lecture, Steven Schick talks about how concepts regarding percussion and performance might transpose into the realm of music technology. The exploratory and forward-moving thinking of music from the late 20th and early 21st century often driven by creators (such as engineers) and composers, and the process of consolidation - the creation of language and performance practice - often driven by performers is discussed. This lecture examines the role of performer and consolidation, the concept of meaningful limits, and closes with Prof. Schicks musical examples (41:17).","Percussion, Music Technology, Performance Practice, Performance, Contemporary Music"
Distinguished Lecture,CxFVjKMsaTc,2009/01/22,The voice as a musical instrument,Johan Sundberg,Royal Institute of Technology,Sweden,Musical Acoustics & Instruments,"Instruments, Devices and Systems (RA1)","How do singers produce and project their voice, doing so in a way that reaches different levels of expressivity? In a very didactic lecture, Dr. Sundberg unveils these aspects of singing. He starts with a comprehensive yet concise explanation of the physiological and acoustic components of the voice, especially the tuning formants. Following is a discussion on strategies adopted by professional singers to ensure vocal economy, like the manipulation of the first formant and the formant cluster used by female and male singers respectively. Finally, he investigates three principles associated with expressiveness: tempo changes to mark the structure, intonation variation to emphasize contrasts, and time of tone onset to reinforce important notes.","voice source, tuning formants, vocal economy, formant cluster, voice timbre, fundamental frequency, partials"
Distinguished Lecture,z_sFVFsENMg,2009/02/19,Tonality as a colonizing force in African music ,Kofi Agawu,Princeton University,USA,Music Theory,Music Information Research (RA2),"Dr. Agawu defines tonality as a “hierarchically organized system of relations animated by desire,” that, according to him, has been used as both instrument of control and creative language. His lecture is centered on the colonizing potential of forms of tonality exported to Africa mainly through the Protestant hymn, thereby affecting the soundscape of costal regions and urban locations. His discussion on the features of the imagined sound of pre-colonial Africa and the responses to European tonality includes musical excerpts from pygmy pentatonic singing, dundun drumming, art music by the composer Joshua Uzoigwe, and new traditional music. All musical examples are thoroughly analyzed, leading to a profound insight into the dynamics of tonal influences.","tonality, African colonization, Protestant hymn, pre-colonial African soundscape, pygmy singing, pentatonism"

He has done much of his work with dancers, getting them to express various emotions through the same choreography and studying how automatic recognition programs allow us to electronically interpret their movement. With this kind of information, he is then able to extrapolate something much bigger: the understanding of empathy and synchronization between people in social environments.","emotion, society, research, computation"
Distinguished Lecture,UN_j04vyvS0,2009/09/24,Learning structures in natural sounds,Michael Lewicki,Case Western Reserve University,USA,Audio Processing,"Cognition, Perception and Movement (RA3)","Lewicki looks at the processing of sound in two facets: the digital processing and analysis of audio tracks (engineering), and the physical structure of human aural mechanisms, the ear (physiology). Because his work deals with both physics and biology, he must find a way to reconcile both familiar laws of physics as well as logic of evolutionary biology as it applies to humans. Like many others, he uses theoretical models from nature to form efficient coding theory - and eventually uses this to learn about higher-order structure. In other words, computer programming is used to analyze sets of audio data from the biological world, which can then tell us about physical structures of organisms that evolved.","evolutionary biology, computer science, technology, programming"

The room acoustics and the acoustic properties of the instruments, he explains, have an impact on the sound impression of the listener. His lecture includes an encompassing discussion on reverberation, decay times of multiple instruments, loudness curves, synchronicity (rhythmic precision) in chamber music, and sound radiation. Based on acoustical and artistic arguments, he also addresses the differences between the German (classical) and the American orchestral seating arrangement. Lastly, he discusses the acoustic demands from the point of view of the performer and the conductor.","acoustics, sound radiation, acoustic properties, orchestra's seating arrangement, decay, loudness, synchronicity, sound level, masking effect"

It's what makes music social and shareable, and allows for the creation of interpersonal cohesion - well-known nursery rhymes are sung early on by children, for example, and the familiarity of old pieces of music provides comfort and a link to past memories. Margulis talks about her intuition for why the first notes of one's favourite song might spark their excitement, and how repeating motives might exist to serve as connections to people and things in the real world - as well as differentiating and bringing attention to otherwise unnoticeable elements.","repetition, analysis, perception, classical, songs"
Distinguished Lecture,Vzf19l-Ztsk,2010/01/21,Does Music Make You Smarter,Glenn Schellenberg,University of Toronto,Canada,Perception & Cognition,Expanded Musical Practice (RA4),"The popular theory of the “Mozart Effect” states that listening to the music of Mozart increases intellectual ability by priming the brain. Schellenberg presents research-based conclusions concerning the idea of unique intellectual benefits surrounding music listening and music lessons. His research has uncovered a “Schubert Effect” associated with listening to the music of Schubert and even a “King Effect” from listening to a Stephen King audio book. Schellenberg concludes that music, among other such “catalysts”, can affect arousal and mood, which, in turn, affects performance on intellectual tasks. Further, unlike other common out-of-school activities, music lessons are associated with small but broad intellectual benefits. ","mozart effect, intellectual benefit, music lessons, psychology "

Research Laboratory,USA,Music Information Retrieval,Music Information Research (RA2),"In the last decades, the volume and multi-media usage of online music use has exploded. Personalized data from photos, videos, ratings, tags and posts is now abundantly available, resulting in rich yet “noisy”, or context-dependent data. Many tools using this data for user and advertiser satisfaction are no longer adequate. In response, Yahoo! Research is developing tools to increase and improve data. Slaney details these tools and advocates for a “more data wins” approach to data collection, so that one can have more ways to look at, and make judgements about, data or prospective solutions. Discussion is centred around machine learning tools and model-building designed to sift through the vast swaths of data.","Yahoo!

Tracing the motion of a leaf falling through the air with your hand is an example of a physical gesture representing a dynamic process: everyone understands that your hand only represents the leaf, but the gesture perfectly encapsulates the motion. Zibikowski suggests that the pairing of musical and physical gestures represent dynamic processes central to human experience, forming musical grammar. Musical gestures exist in a well-defined context—meter and pitch space—so their measurable properties can lend meaning to corresponding physical gestures.","musical gesture, musical grammar, physical gesture"
Distinguished Lecture,ii6VtnUVsok,2011/02/17,Building Musical Minds in 18th Century Naples,Robert Gjerdingen,Northwestern University,USA,Musicology,Expanded Musical Practice (RA4),"Beginning with the conservatory tradition of 18th century Naples, Robert Gjerdingen discusses the use of schemata in improvisation and composition. Schemata are stock harmonic patterns, a lexicon of solfegi melodies and partimenti bass patterns that permeated 18th and 19th century music. Learning the schemata allows practitioners to build a phrasacon of musical idioms, and gain an understanding of the collocation (how the material fits together) and appropriate frequency of the different patterns. In this tradition, practitioners learn a corpus of coherent utterances, as to not only grasp the mechanics of the patterns, but learn the style of the musical tradition.","schemata, musical patterns, 18th century composition"

Pioneering contributor to computer music, Risset, explores the possibilities of computer sound synthesis in composition. Beyond this topic, he delves into the psychoacoustics of sound: how we interpret what we hear. Risset shares how modern computer sound synthesis has ushered in new and varied possibilities that are increasingly congenial to our senses. As Risset proposes, there seems to be an aspect of magic in music that can be enhanced by using the somewhat extreme features of perception involved in synthesis.","psychoacoustics, perception, computer music, sound synthesis"

This is what Marco Stroppa has done a lot of thinking about, and he has spent his research work experimenting with acoustic piano sounds and their resonances - and also the complex process of digitalized composing not with these exact sonorities but unique ones inspired by them. As a composer with much experience and knowledge in piano techniques and instrumentation, he dives into the technical details of creating ""pure"" and ""noisy"" tone, as well as artistic lines and creativity.

Each stroke is created quasi-linguistically via variation in place and manner of articulation, and each bol represents a stroke. Patel argues that bols are a case of “sound symbolism”: in tabla drumming, musical timbres are both reflective by and reflective of speech timbres. Using empirical data, Patel suggests that for experienced drummers, the areas of the brain know to be activated by speech would also be activated by tabla timbres.","timbre, tabla drumming, non-lingusitic systems"

Her research grapples with the use of motion in musical expressivity during musical performance as evaluated by musicians and non-musicians. Is there an expressive repertoire of gestures, and if so, how are they used? Her research suggests that musicians develop a personal musical movement repertoire within a socio-cultural context. Beyond discussing this repertoire of expressive movements and how it is put into use, Davidson invites us to consider what social studies can add to this discussion.","movement, expression, gesture"

In this lecture, Petr Janata examines the movement of music through tonal space using various behavioural and neuro-imaging techniques combined with computational approaches. These methods are used to try to understand how we process tonality, and how it links to a strong experience of music-evoked autobiographical memories. While there are multiple brain areas that interact when memories are experienced with music-listening, the challenge lies in examining how these interactions combine to structure our experience.

In this lecture he stresses on the concept of 'interactivity' where the performer influences the electronic system to produce music while the electronic system influences the performer by giving the performer something to react to. Watch until the end to catch a very special event!","music as emergence, electronic music, interactive media, interactive composing"
COBS keynote,JFfulvpQxng,2019/05/09,Acoustic defence and technologies of listening during the First World War,Gascia Ouzounian,University of Oxford,UK,Musicology,"Instruments, Devices and Systems (RA1)","During the First World War (WWI) new forms of warfare necessitated new methods of acoustic defense, for instance, tracking the enemy through listening. Proud McGill alumni, Gascia Ouzounian weaves together some of the highlights from a chapter of her book 'Stereophonica' which explores the history of acoustic and auditory spatiality since the early 1800s. This talk investigates the development of WWI-era acoustic defence technologies, including geophones, double trumpet sound locators and acoustic goniometers. Watch this lecture to hear many fun facts and a really informative presentation on the evolution of spatial technologies. ","music history, spatial listening, multichannel reproduction, acoustics, auditory spatiality, binarual technologies"
Distinguished Lecture,V4OPo_EaIe4,2019/09/19,Ear - Mind - Brain: The mysteries of musical similarity,Eleanor Selfridge-Field,Stanford University,USA,Music Information Retrieval,Music Information Research (RA2),"In music, it is very common for artists to perform and record the musical works of other musicians. The concept of musical similarity seems simple. Evaluating similarity becomes more complicated when specific pieces are put forward. They may be similar in genre, style, meaning, mood, melody and/or associated rhythm; this can get very confusing and has raised copyright issues, even with accompanying lawsuits. This talk reviews several approaches to the understanding of musical similarity using theoretical approaches, cultural/cognitive factors, methods of masking an obvious melody and so on. Selfridge-Field presents live examples of a few famous copyright disputes and ends on a little test for the watcher!","musical similarity, music cognition, music information retreival, digital musicology, music history, intellectual property"
Distinguished Lecture,dKoZmxP7rSA,2019/10/24,Trust your ears! The quest for the optimum (digital) audio representation,Claude Cellier,Merging Technologies,Switzerland,Audio Processing,"Instruments, Devices and Systems (RA1)","In this talk Claude Cellier, CEO of Merging Technologies, known for his invention of the DXD (Digital eXtreme Definition) range of high-end audio products, reviews some of the formidable changes that the audio industry underwent over the last 60 years. He presents a variety of audio examples (some of which are produced at McGill) supported with intuitive graphs that will convince us of the difference between traditional encoding standards such as PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) and the newer standards such as DSD (Direct Stream Digital) and DXD. If you think it is sufficient to stick to current audio representation methods, watch this video to understand what important information we are missing out on because of age-old audio capture and reproduction techniques.","high-fidelity audio, audio representation, audio encoding, digital signal processing"
