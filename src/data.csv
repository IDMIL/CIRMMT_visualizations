Distinguished Lecture,mwnPQOoNKTQ,2007/10/25,Musical Origins: Processing Temporal and Spectral Patterns in Infancy,Laurel Trainor,McMaster University,Canada,Neuroscience,+ACI-Cognition, Perception and Movement (RA3)+ACI-,+ACI-Across human societies, music remains a universal experience that all of us +AC0- young and old +AC0- come to experience. From our youngest days as infants, we are exposed to music through the singing of lullabies or rhythm from +ACIAIg-bouncing+ACIAIg-. In this Distinguished Lecture, Professor Laurel Trainor talks about the origins of music in a developmental sense +AC0- how early can humans recognize and learn rhythm and pitch structures, and do specific musical experiences from childhood affect brain development? Various studies are explored, showing that even infants can be sensitive to consonance and dissonance, exhibit the ability to extract rhythmic, or metrical structure, and that the auditory cortex can rapidly mature between the ages of 2+AC0-6 months.+ACI-,+ACI-Early Development, Music, Brain, Perception, Auditory Development+ACI-

Distinguished Lecture,GRrElxJkvIc,2008/02/21,Oscillation regimes of musical wind instruments: The points of view of the physicist and the instrumentalist+//0Awv/9AKA-,Jean Kergomard,+ACI-Laboratoire de M+//0Aw//9AKk-canique et d'Acoustique, CNRS+ACI-,France,Musical Acoustics +ACY- Instruments,+ACI-Instruments, Devices and Systems (RA1)+ACI-,+ACI-Depending on the musical instrument, it is possible to produce up to 20 different sounds with one single fingering. This relationship between fingering and resulting sound is determined by the oscillation regimes, which is why it is essential for the musician to learn to control them. Dr. Kergomard shows how these regimes apply to wind instruments, particularly the clarinet. Using different models and bifurcation schemes, he investigates the behavior of sound in nonlinear systems. His lecture includes a review of elementary acoustics, results from an experiment that uses an artificial mouth, and even a theoretical explanation of why clarinets squeak.+ACI-,+ACI-bifurcation schemes, acoustics, clarinet, oscillation regimes, self+AC0-sustained oscillations+ACI-
Distinguished Lecture,D5EJLQlUigM,2009/03/27,Mining for the Meaning of Music,Dan Ellis,Columbia University,USA,Music Information Retrieval,Music Information Research (RA2),+ACI-What does the term +ACIAIg-music+ACIAIg- denote? Can we define music?  As a professor of electrical engineering and leader of the Laboratory for Recognition and Organization of Speech and Audio (LabROSA), Ellis explores large collections of music samples in order to produce +//0A4v/9AID//QCc-a condensed space+//0A4v/9AID//QCd- in which to identify and label musical qualities and provide definitions. His extensive research has encompassed drumbeat rhythms and melody analysis. The aim of his melody research is to provide a dictionary of common motifs (clich+//0Aw//9AKk-s) in musical melodies. Additionally, Ellis studies the meanings or labels individuals attribute to music, and this research, in turn, has implications as to how music is to be classified.+ACI-,+ACI-rhythm, melody, motif, principal component analysis, beat tracker+ACI-
Distinguished Lecture,VjSMna75fxY,2008/04/17,Sound Actions: Human Movement in the Perception +ACY- Cognition of Music,Rolf Inge God+//0Aw//9ALg-y,University of Oslo,Norway,Movement,+ACI-Cognition, Perception and Movement (RA3)+ACI-,+ACI-Movement is everywhere: from walking down the street, to hand gestures while speaking, to a musician's movement during a performance. Regardless of musical training and background, humans are observed to spontaneously generate movements that reflect musical features. In this lecture, Professor Godoy reviews various studies on music and movement and how these findings may influence other areas of music research such as music perception cognition and music theory. By examining the link between music and movement, Prof. Godoy speaks on how human movement plays an integral part in music perception and music cognition in general. The lecture ends with a conclusion of topics, as well as issues, concerns, and suggestions for future work.+ACI-,+ACI-Perception, Cognition, Movement, Music Theory, +ACI-
Distinguished Lecture,S7AOZIGP9Ys,2008/10/16,Slippery Rocks: A Low+AC0-Tech Percussionist Navigates the Crosscurrents of Music Technology,Steven Schick,+ACI-University of California, San Diego+ACI-,USA,Music Performance +ACY- Education,Expanded Musical Practice (RA4),+ACI-Percussion and music technology have often been lumped together as +ACIAIg-new technology from the 20th century,+ACIAIg- involving the +ACIAIg-liberation+ACIAIg- or refinement of sound, and largely involving the culture of addition. In this lecture, Steven Schick talks about how concepts regarding percussion and performance might transpose into the realm of music technology. The exploratory and forward+AC0-moving thinking of music from the late 20th and early 21st century often driven by creators (such as engineers) and composers, and the process of consolidation +AC0- the creation of language and performance practice +AC0- often driven by performers is discussed.

Distinguished Lecture,CxFVjKMsaTc,2009/01/22,The voice as a musical instrument,Johan Sundberg,Royal Institute of Technology,Sweden,Musical Acoustics +ACY- Instruments,+ACI-Instruments, Devices and Systems (RA1)+ACI-,+ACI-How do singers produce and project their voice, doing so in a way that reaches different levels of expressivity? In a very didactic lecture, Dr. Sundberg unveils these aspects of singing. He starts with a comprehensive yet concise explanation of the physiological and acoustic components of the voice, especially the tuning formants. Following is a discussion on strategies adopted by professional singers to ensure vocal economy, like the manipulation of the first formant and the formant cluster used by female and male singers respectively. Finally, he investigates three principles associated with expressiveness: tempo changes to mark the structure, intonation variation to emphasize contrasts, and time of tone onset to reinforce important notes.+ACI-,+ACI-voice source, tuning formants, vocal economy, formant cluster, voice timbre, fundamental frequency, partials+ACI-
Distinguished Lecture,z+AF8-sFVFsENMg,2009/02/19,Tonality as a colonizing force in African music+//0Awv/9AKA-,Kofi Agawu,Princeton University,USA,Music Theory,Music Information Research (RA2),+ACI-Dr. Agawu defines tonality as a +//0A4v/9AID//QCc-hierarchically organized system of relations animated by desire,+//0A4v/9AID//QCd- that, according to him, has been used as both instrument of control and creative language. His lecture is centered on the colonizing potential of forms of tonality exported to Africa mainly through the Protestant hymn, thereby affecting the soundscape of costal regions and urban locations. His discussion on the features of the imagined sound of pre+AC0-colonial Africa and the responses to European tonality includes musical excerpts from pygmy pentatonic singing, dundun drumming, art music by the composer Joshua Uzoigwe, and new traditional music. All musical examples are thoroughly analyzed, leading to a profound insight into the dynamics of tonal influences.+ACI-,+ACI-tonality, African colonization, Protestant hymn, pre+AC0-colonial African soundscape, pygmy singing, pentatonism+ACI-

While the aging brain may face cognitive difficulties, particularly those suffering from dementia of the Alzheimer's type, normal aging patients as well as those in moderate to severe stages of dementia can exhibit preserved memory for melody and lyrics. In this talk, Professor Lola Cuddy explores the topic of music and the aging brain by speaking on approaches to studying musical memory, with a focus on melodies, the challenges of research in patients with dementia, and her own work. Various case studies and their data are examined, and a brief overview of the work done in this field is explored.+ACI-,+ACI-Aging, Perception, Cognition, Dementia, Alzheimer's,+ACI-
Distinguished Lecture,XLBOBMY+AF8-vDQ,2009/04/16,Music and emotion: Toward Computational Models of Empathy and Entrainment,Antonio Camurri,University of Genoa,Italy,Computer Music Systems,+ACI-Cognition, Perception and Movement (RA3)+ACI-,+ACI-Camurri provides a one+AC0-of+AC0-a+AC0-kind insight into the ground+AC0-breaking research he is currently conducting at Italy's University of Genoa, which involves examining the relevance of the performing arts and their potential contribution to the progression of technology and science. He has done much of his work with dancers, getting them to express various emotions through the same choreography and studying how automatic recognition programs allow us to electronically interpret their movement. With this kind of information, he is then able to extrapolate something much bigger: the understanding of empathy and synchronization between people in social environments.+ACI-,+ACI-emotion, society, research, computation+ACI-
Distinguished Lecture,UN+AF8-j04vyvS0,2009/09/24,Learning structures in natural sounds,Michael Lewicki,Case Western Reserve University,USA,Audio Processing,+ACI-Cognition, Perception and Movement (RA3)+ACI-,+ACI-Lewicki looks at the processing of sound in two facets: the digital processing and analysis of audio tracks (engineering), and the physical structure of human aural mechanisms, the ear (physiology). Because his work deals with both physics and biology, he must find a way to reconcile both familiar laws of physics as well as logic of evolutionary biology as it applies to humans. Like many others, he uses theoretical models from nature to form efficient coding theory +AC0- and eventually uses this to learn about higher+AC0-order structure. In other words, computer programming is used to analyze sets of audio data from the biological world, which can then tell us about physical structures of organisms that evolved.+ACI-,+ACI-evolutionary biology, computer science, technology, programming+ACI-
Distinguished Lecture,rn2+AF8-fFcRZlY,2009/10/25,The sound of orchestras and soloists as a combination of room acoustics and acoustical properties of the musical instruments,Jurgen Meyer,University of Music Detmold,Germany,Musical Acoustics +ACY- Instruments,+ACI-Instruments, Devices and Systems (RA1)+ACI-,+ACI-When it comes down to understanding the resulting sound of a musical performance, Dr. Meyer shows that there is much more to be considered than what musicians usually pay attention to. The room acoustics and the acoustic properties of the instruments, he explains, have an impact on the sound impression of the listener. His lecture includes an encompassing discussion on reverberation, decay times of multiple instruments, loudness curves, synchronicity (rhythmic precision) in chamber music, and sound radiation. Based on acoustical and artistic arguments, he also addresses the differences between the German (classical) and the American orchestral seating arrangement. Lastly, he discusses the acoustic demands from the point of view of the performer and the conductor.+ACI-,+ACI-acoustics, sound radiation, acoustic properties, orchestra's seating arrangement, decay, loudness, synchronicity, sound level, masking effect+ACI-

It's what makes music social and shareable, and allows for the creation of interpersonal cohesion +AC0- well+AC0-known nursery rhymes are sung early on by children, for example, and the familiarity of old pieces of music provides comfort and a link to past memories. Margulis talks about her intuition for why the first notes of one's favourite song might spark their excitement, and how repeating motives might exist to serve as connections to people and things in the real world +AC0- as well as differentiating and bringing attention to otherwise unnoticeable elements.+ACI-,+ACI-repetition, analysis, perception, classical, songs+ACI-
Distinguished Lecture,Vzf19l+AC0-Ztsk,2010/01/21,Does Music Make You Smarter,Glenn Schellenberg,University of Toronto,Canada,Perception +ACY- Cognition,Expanded Musical Practice (RA4),+ACI-The popular theory of the +//0A4v/9AID//QCc-Mozart Effect+//0A4v/9AID//QCd- states that listening to the music of Mozart increases intellectual ability by priming the brain. Schellenberg presents research+AC0-based conclusions concerning the idea of unique intellectual benefits surrounding music listening and music lessons. His research has uncovered a +//0A4v/9AID//QCc-Schubert Effect+//0A4v/9AID//QCd- associated with listening to the music of Schubert and even a +//0A4v/9AID//QCc-King Effect+//0A4v/9AID//QCd- from listening to a Stephen King audio book. Schellenberg concludes that music, among other such +//0A4v/9AID//QCc-catalysts+//0A4v/9AID//QCd-, can affect arousal and mood, which, in turn, affects performance on intellectual tasks. Further, unlike other common out+AC0-of+AC0-school activities, music lessons are associated with small but broad intellectual benefits. +ACI-,+ACI-mozart effect, intellectual benefit, music lessons, psychology +ACI-

Tracing the motion of a leaf falling through the air with your hand is an example of a physical gesture representing a dynamic process: everyone understands that your hand only represents the leaf, but the gesture perfectly encapsulates the motion. Zibikowski suggests that the pairing of musical and physical gestures represent dynamic processes central to human experience, forming musical grammar. Musical gestures exist in a well+AC0-defined context+//0A4v/9AID//QCU-meter and pitch space+//0A4v/9AID//QCU-so their measurable properties can lend meaning to corresponding physical gestures.+ACI-,+ACI-musical gesture, musical grammar, physical gesture+ACI-
Distinguished Lecture,ii6VtnUVsok,2011/02/17,Building Musical Minds in 18th Century Naples,Robert Gjerdingen,Northwestern University,USA,Musicology,Expanded Musical Practice (RA4),+ACI-Beginning with the conservatory tradition of 18th century Naples, Robert Gjerdingen discusses the use of schemata in improvisation and composition. Schemata are stock harmonic patterns, a lexicon of solfegi melodies and partimenti bass patterns that permeated 18th and 19th century music. Learning the schemata allows practitioners to build a phrasacon of musical idioms, and gain an understanding of the collocation (how the material fits together) and appropriate frequency of the different patterns. In this tradition, practitioners learn a corpus of coherent utterances, as to not only grasp the mechanics of the patterns, but learn the style of the musical tradition.+ACI-,+ACI-schemata, musical patterns, 18th century composition+ACI-

Pioneering contributor to computer music, Risset, explores the possibilities of computer sound synthesis in composition. Beyond this topic, he delves into the psychoacoustics of sound: how we interpret what we hear. Risset shares how modern computer sound synthesis has ushered in new and varied possibilities that are increasingly congenial to our senses. As Risset proposes, there seems to be an aspect of magic in music that can be enhanced by using the somewhat extreme features of perception involved in synthesis.+ACI-,+ACI-psychoacoustics, perception, computer music, sound synthesis+ACI-

Other topics presented include embodiments of meter in music induced movement (MIM), musical characteristics and MIM, listener characteristics and MIM, and perception of MIM. His findings suggest the metric hierarchies that exists in music are embedded in MIM. Characteristics of the music, such as pulse clarity and the emotional quality of the music tend to produce corresponding movements. MIM also encodes personality traits, emotion, and gender.  +ACI-,+ACI-movement, dance, personality, gender+ACI-

Student Symposium KEYNOTE,GtSCVqIDl+AC0-k,2012/05/23,On the Psycholophysics of Musical Expressivity,Daniel Levitin,McGill University,Canada,Perception +ACY- Cognition,+ACI-Cognition, Perception and Movement (RA3)+ACI-,+ACI-Daniel Levitin and his team explore ways to quantify the expressivity of a musical performance. With the help of Yamaha's Disklavier,  Daniel and his team artifically produce less expressive versions of musical excerpts. These are then rated for expressivity in a controlled study. Daniel and his team observe various trends that connect expressive performance to variations in dynamics and timing of the performance. Further investigations show that beyond a point, the variation doesn't continue to translate into an expressive quality. The team also explores the same conditions in autistic children, where the study shows that people with autism are unable to determine expressivity in performances from timing and dynamic variation.+ACI-,+ACI-Expressivity, Psycophysics, autism, Psycophysical expressivity curve, Disklavier, MIDI, Piano performance, Piano expressivity.+ACI-

The relationship between sign and sound was affected by new extended acoustic possibilities. Composers saw an opportunity to have an exact sonic representation of their musical ideas without any written notation. For the first time, music could be inscribed instead of prescribed. Interestingly, music scores continued to be used.

Distinguished Lecture,SyixalrH7xo,2018/01/02,Composing the real,Trevor Wishart,Composer +ACY- Performer,UK,Composition,Expanded Musical Practice (RA4),+ACI-Trevor Wishart writes music using speech but in a unique and unconventional way. Instead of focusing on the narrative content he studies the sonic qualities of syllables from multiple languages and manipulates them aiming for a balance between technical and musical aesthetic exploration. Through the morphing of the voice he is then able to mimic the sound of bees or even bells. In his lecture, he shares these creative and compositional processes as well as many excerpts of his music. The details include challenges with collecting material for his compositions, some rather funny anecdotes, and the software programming he does himself in order to accomplish his musical ideas.  +ACI-,+ACI-extended vocal techniques, electro+AC0-acoustics, sound morphing, sonic qualities+ACI-
