This visualization tool was developed for the CIRMMT Distinguished Lecture (DL) series, a unique <i>video encyclopedia of Music, Science and Technology</i>.<br>
<br>
The DL series consists of several dozen 1-hour videos of leading scholars and artists discussing their interdisciplinary work in length (www.cirmmt.org/video). Though this collection in itself is already an invaluable research and pedagogical tool, searching videos in the collection is not a trivial task given the diversity of fields and topics. To facilitate the navigation in the collection, we developed this tool representing textual metadata of videos in a hierarchical bubble chart.<br>
<br>
The paper "A Visualization Tool for the CIRMMT Distinguished Lecture Series‚Äù to appear in the 2020 HCI International Conference describes the DL series and discusses the iterative prototyping of the visualization tool.<br>
<br>
This tool was developed at the Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory (IDMIL), McGill University (<a href="http://www.idmil.org">www.idmil.org</a>) for the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT) (<a href="http://www.cirmmt.org">www.cirmmt.org</a>) by Mathias Bredholt, Christian Frisson and Marcelo M.
